# ryan-green-work-day-scheduler

## Description

This challenge was yo use started code to make a scheduler that lets you save a text input to different hours of the day. It also shows the current, past and future hours by color using day.js. Besides using day.js, I also used some jquery and got more practice with local storage and building an app using pre-made css.
